# Welcome to PersonalLibraryApp!

This WebApp is designed to help you keep track of your reading journey, as well as the reading journey of your family. With this app, you will be able to easily organize and manage the books you've read, the books you're currently reading and the books you want to read in the future.

PersonalLibraryApp is built with C# and React. It uses the **Entity Framework** to interact with the database. It serves as an exercise for developing my skills in these technologies. The app is user-friendly and easy to navigate, making it a perfect tool for book lovers everywhere. With PersonalLibraryApp, you'll never have to worry about losing track of your reading list again.

Thank you for choosing PersonalLibraryApp, and happy reading!
