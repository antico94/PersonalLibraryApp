# Welcome to PersonalLibraryApp!

This WebApp is designed to help you keep track of your reading journey, as well as the reading journey of your family. With PersonalLibraryApp, you can easily organize and manage the books you've read, the books you're currently reading, and the books you want to read in the future. It allows you to create a personal reading library, where you can keep track of your favorite books, authors and genres, and get recommendations based on your reading history.

PersonalLibraryApp is built with C# and React. It uses the **Entity Framework** to interact with the database and store the information about the books, the authors and the genres. It serves as an exercise for developing my skills in these technologies. The app has a user-friendly and easy to navigate interface, making it a perfect tool for book lovers everywhere. You can easily search for books by title, author, or genre, and add them to your reading lists, with just a few clicks.

With PersonalLibraryApp, you'll never have to worry about losing track of your reading list again. You can easily keep track of the books you've read, the books you're currently reading, and the books you want to read in the future. You can also set reminders for upcoming releases, and rate the books you've read, so you can easily find them again.

Thank you for choosing PersonalLibraryApp, and happy reading!
